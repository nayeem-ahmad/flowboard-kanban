# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Provide a simple, intuitive platform for managing projects using Scrum/Kanban methodologies
- Enable teams to visualize work progress through Trello-like boards
- Support complete sprint management with backlog, planning, and burndown tracking
- Facilitate team collaboration through invites, comments, and card sharing
- Deliver time tracking capabilities for sprint burndown and capacity planning

## Background Context
Scrum71 addresses the need for a lightweight yet feature-complete project management tool that combines the visual simplicity of Kanban boards with Scrum practices like sprints, backlogs, and burndown charts. Many existing tools are either too complex for small teams or lack essential Scrum features. Scrum71 bridges this gap by offering an approachable interface with powerful sprint tracking capabilities, time-based burndown visualization, and seamless team collaboration features.
