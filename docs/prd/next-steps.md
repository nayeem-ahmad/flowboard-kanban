# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Review the Scrum71 PRD at docs/prd.md and create a comprehensive front-end specification. Focus on the core screens (Auth, Board View, Card Modal, Project Management), component hierarchy, interaction patterns, and responsive behavior. Consider the existing vanilla JS architecture."

## Architect Prompt
"Review the Scrum71 PRD at docs/prd.md and create the technical architecture document. Focus on the existing vanilla JS + Firebase stack, data models for projects/boards/cards, Firestore security rules, and real-time sync patterns. Address how attachments will use Firebase Storage."
