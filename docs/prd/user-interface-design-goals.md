# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A clean, modern interface inspired by Trello's simplicity with enhanced Scrum capabilities. The design emphasizes visual hierarchy, smooth animations, and intuitive drag-and-drop interactions. Glass-morphism effects and gradient backgrounds provide a contemporary feel while maintaining readability.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Drag and Drop**: Primary method for moving cards between lists and reordering
- **Modal Dialogs**: Used for card details, project info, and settings
- **Dropdown Selectors**: For project and board switching in the header
- **Inline Editing**: List titles and card quick-edit are editable in place
- **Floating Panels**: Burndown chart as a collapsible floating element

## Core Screens and Views
1. **Auth Screen**: Login/Register/Password Reset forms with social auth options
2. **Main Board View**: Kanban board with lists, cards, and add buttons
3. **Card Modal**: Full card editing with description, checklist, labels, time tracking, comments, attachments
4. **Project Info Modal**: Project details, team members, invite link management
5. **Project Management Screen**: Sidebar list of projects with backlog, sprints, and team tabs
6. **Search Modal**: Quick search overlay with keyboard navigation
7. **Board Creation Modal**: New board form with name and background color picker

## Accessibility
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators and skip links
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Screen reader compatible markup

## Branding
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Color Palette**: Purple/indigo gradients as accent, neutral grays for surfaces
- **Logo**: Abstract Kanban board icon with "Scrum71" wordmark
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark modes with smooth transitions

## Target Platforms
Web Responsive - optimized for desktop (primary), tablet, and mobile viewports
