# Story 2.2: Project Management Screen

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** a dedicated screen to manage project details,  
**so that** I can configure backlogs, sprints, and team.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project management screen shows sidebar list of projects
2. Selecting project displays detail panel with tabs
3. Tabs include: Backlog, Sprints, Team
4. Project name/description are editable
5. Screen can be exited to return to board view
6. Empty state prompts project creation

- [ ] Task 3: Details Panel & Tabs
  - [ ] Create main content area with tabs (Backlog, Sprints, Team)
  - [ ] Implement tab switching logic

## Dev Notes
- Reuse existing modal/form styles.
- State management needs to track `viewMode` (Board vs ProjectMgmt).
